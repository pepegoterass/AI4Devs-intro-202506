you are a software developer expert. i need you to help me with the next exercise. Create a **web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string**.

Example: if I input AI4Devs, it should return sveD4IA.

Do it using the seed files index.html and script.js provided in the template folder.

Use a chatbot like ChatGPT or Gemini, not a code assistant in an IDE like Github Copilot.

To submit, make a pull request that includes a folder copied from the template, named reversestring-initials (for example, reversestring-ARM). It must include not only the generated code but also, importantly, **the prompt used and the chatbot utilized** in prompts.md. If you used more than one prompt to reach a suitable solution, include them all in order. Also, include the final prompt in the pull request comment.

Good luck!
